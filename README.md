## Overview of Analysis
V. Isualize has assigned Omar and me to create a summary dataframe of ride share data broken down by rural, suburban, and urban rides. Additionally, we created a line graph to displa total weekly fares for rural, suburban, and urban rides for the period between January 1st, 2019 and April 29th, 2019. 

## Results

### Total Rides
As might be expected based on population density, urban rides were most common, representing 1,625 of all rides. Suburban rides were next most common with 625 rides, and rural reides were the least common, with 125 rides. 

### Total Drivers
Correspondingly, the total number of drivers follows the same pattern as the number of rides. Urban areas have the most drivers - 2,405, suburban areas have less - 490, and rural areas have the least with 78 drivers.
