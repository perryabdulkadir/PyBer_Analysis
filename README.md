## Overview of Analysis
V. Isualize has assigned Omar and me to create a summary dataframe of ride share data broken down by rural, suburban, and urban rides. Additionally, we created a line graph to displa total weekly fares for rural, suburban, and urban rides for the period between January 1st, 2019 and April 29th, 2019. 

## Results

### Total Rides
As might be expected based on population density, urban rides were most common, representing 1,625 of all rides. Suburban rides were next most common with 625 rides, and rural reides were the least common, with 125 rides. 

### Total Drivers
Correspondingly, the total number of drivers follows the same pattern as the number of rides. Urban areas have the most drivers - 2,405, suburban areas have less - 490, and rural areas have the least with 78 drivers. 

### Total Fares
Urban areas contribute the most to fare income - $39,854.38. Suburban regions are next with $19,356.33 in total fares. Finally, rural areas bring in the least total fare revenue - $4,327.93. 

### Average Fare per Ride
While rural areas might represent the fewest number of rides and the smallest amount of fare revenue, they actually generate the largest fare per ride - $34.62. In contrast, suburban rides generate $30.97 per ride and urban areas bring in $24.53 per ride on average. 

### Average Fare per Driver
Rural areas also have the smallest number of drivers while simultaneously having the highest average fare per driver - $55.49. Suburban drivers average $39.50 per ride and urban drivers average $16.57 per ride.
